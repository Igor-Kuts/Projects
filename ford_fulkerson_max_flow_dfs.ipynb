    "# Ford - Fulkerson Network Maximum Flow via DFS\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of Ford - Fulkerson algorithm shown below utilizes the Depth First Search for finding augmenting paths during graph traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time complexity**: \n",
    "- <font color=\"orange\" size=\"3\"><b>O(fE)</b></font>, where *f* is the maxumum flow and *E* is the number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and the network maximum flow problem have various real-world applications. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transportation Networks**: The maximum flow problem can be applied to transportation networks, such as traffic flow in road networks or the flow of goods in supply chain systems. By determining the maximum flow between nodes, we can optimize the utilization of resources and identify potential bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Telecommunications**: Network flow algorithms are used in telecommunications to optimize data transmission across a network, such as routing data packets through routers or allocating bandwidth in communication networks. Maximizing the flow can help improve the efficiency and reliability of data transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Water Distribution**: The maximum flow algorithm can be applied to optimize the distribution of water in a network of pipes or canals. By determining the maximum flow, we can ensure that water is efficiently allocated to different regions, taking into account constraints such as pipe capacities and demand at different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Energy Networks**: The maximum flow problem is relevant to energy distribution networks, such as electrical power grids. It can be used to optimize the flow of electricity, considering factors like power generation, transmission line capacities, and consumer demands. This helps in managing the load balance and preventing overloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image Segmentation**: In computer vision, the max-flow/min-cut algorithm (a related concept) is used for image segmentation. It helps to separate an image into meaningful regions by finding the optimal cut that separates foreground and background pixels based on the concept of maximum flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network maximum flow problem involves determining the maximum flow that can be sent through a network from a source to a sink, considering capacity limits on edges. It's represented by a directed graph where nodes are entities and edges are connections. The goal is to find the most efficient flow route while respecting capacity constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm iteratively finds paths from source to sink that can accommodate more flow. By updating flow values along these paths, it increases the overall flow until no more paths exist. The algorithm stops when adding more flow would violate capacity limits, yielding the maximum flow value and flow distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem and algorithm have practical applications in optimizing transportation networks, telecommunications, water distribution, energy grids, and image segmentation. They enable resource allocation, efficiency improvement, and informed decision-making in various scenarios."
