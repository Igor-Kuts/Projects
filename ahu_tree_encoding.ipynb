    "# AHU Tree Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The AHU (Aho, Hopcroft, Ullman) algorithm is a **clever serialization technique for representing a tree as a unique string**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many tree isomorphism invariants and heuristics, AHI is able to capture a <font color=\"orange\" size=\"3\"><b>complete history</b></font> of a tree's <font color=\"slate\" size=\"3\"><b>degree spectrum</b></font> and structure ensuring a deterministic method of checking for tree isomorphisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTES**:\n",
    "- AHU is better performed on a rooted trees.\n",
    "    - Appropriate algorithms will be used for choosing the right root node and for rooting tree.\n",
    "    - Rooted tree will be stored as class objects for better encapsulation and ease of access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Start by assigning all leaf nodes Knuth tuples: `'()'`\n",
    "2. Every time you move up a layer the labels of the previous subtrees get sorted lexicographically and wrapped in brackets.\n",
    "\t1. Labels need to get **sorted** lexicographically when combined for an algorithm to work.\n",
    "3. You cannot process a node until you have processed all its children."
