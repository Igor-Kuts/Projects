    "# Find Eulerian Path via DFS\n",
    "\n",
    "Eulerian Path is useful in any situation where one needs to find a path that traverses all the edges of a graph exactly once.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity: : <font color=\"green\" size=\"3\"><b>O(E)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some of the use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Network optimization: to optimize the flow of goods or people through a network of roads or transportation systems\n",
    "2. Logistics planning: to plan delivery routes for goods or people. By finding the Eulerian path through the network, one can minimize the distance traveled or the number of vehicles needed to complete the deliveries.\n",
    "3. Circuit design: In designing electronic circuits, it is often necessary to find a path that traverses all the components in the circuit exactly once\n",
    "4. DNA sequencing: The algorithm can also be used in bioinformatics to help sequence DNA."
